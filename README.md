This repository contains the exercises for the training event on FedCloud at the <a href="http://www.digitalinfrastructures.eu/"> Digital Infrastructures for Research (DI4R)</a> conference.

## Requirements

For compiling most exercises you will need:
* Java SDK 7+
* [maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

The [EGI Federated Cloud clients Virtual Appliance](https://appdb.egi.eu/store/vappliance/egi.fedcloud.clients)
contains a ready to use environment to compile these exercises and several related tools
(e.g. rOCCI command line interface)

You will need a valid X.509 certificate and to belong to one of the Virtual Organisations supported at
the EGI cloud providers. During the event you will be given a temporary credential, for obtaining 
permanent credentials, check the
